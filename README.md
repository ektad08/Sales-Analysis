## Problem Statement
The sales team of a company needs a comprehensive view of sales performance and customer insights to drive strategic decision-making and business growth. They lack a centralized dashboard that can provide actionable insights based on sales data.
## Data Analysis using Excel
Excel was used to analyze sales data, including calculating total sales, profit margins, and customer counts. Various Excel functions and tools were utilized to perform calculations and generate insights from the dataset.
## Data Cleaning
The sales data was cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency. This involved removing duplicates, correcting errors, and handling missing values. Data formatting was also applied to make the dataset suitable for analysis.
## Build Dashboard
A dashboard was created in Excel to visualize key sales metrics and insights. The dashboard includes features such as sales by category, profit over time, sales by state, customer count, top 5 customers by profit, and monthly sales analysis. These visualizations help in identifying trends, top-performing categories, and regions with the highest sales volumes
